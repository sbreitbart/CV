              known about how these pressures impact species interactions.
              Studies of urban plant-pollinator systems provide mounting
              evidence that urbanization impairs pollinator movement in
              fragmented urban landscapes, yet the consequences for
              pollinator-mediated plant reproduction remains unclear. In
              non-urban areas, habitat corridors can facilitate the movement of
              organisms including pollinators, but whether these corridors
              facilitate plant-pollinator interactions in urban areas remains
              understudied. To examine how urban environments and a green
              corridor influence plant-pollinator interactions, we measured
              reproductive success in the native plant common milkweed
              (Asclepias syriaca), and the community structure of its
              pollinators, for two years along two urban--rural transects in
              the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, one of which followed a green
              corridor. We found that urbanization decreased male fitness
              (i.e., pollen removal), increased fruit set (i.e., mean no. of
              follicles per inflorescence), and inconsistently affected female
              fitness (i.e., no. of follicles) in A. syriaca. Urbanization
              simultaneously decreased pollinator abundance but increased
              pollinator richness. Proximity to a green corridor inconsistently
              affected male fitness but increased reproductive effort (i.e.,
              no. of inflorescences) in A. syriaca, while pollinator diversity
              and richness was lower in the corridor. Notably, there were no
              consistent relationships between pollinator community structure
              and reproductive success in A. syriaca in both the presence, and
              absence, of a green corridor. These results demonstrate the
              complexity with which urbanization, a green corridor, and
              pollinator communities can shape the reproductive investment and
              fitness of native plant populations.",

  abstract = "Urbanization is quickly changing natural and agricultural
              landscapes, with consequences for the herbivorous arthropods
              dwelling in or near cities. Here, we review the evidence for the
              effects of urbanization on the ecology and evolution of
              plant-herbivore interactions. We first summarize how abiotic
              factors associated with urbanization affect the ecology and
              evolution of herbivorous arthropods. Next, we explore how
              urbanization affects plant-herbivore interactions, by considering
              how urban environments may disrupt top-down and bottom-up
              ecological processes that affect herbivory. Abiotic changes in
              the urban environment, such as the urban heat island effect, have
              caused shifts in phenology for some herbivorous arthropods. Other
              abiotic changes in urban areas, including water availability,
              pollution, and habitat fragmentation, have resulted in changes to
              physiology, behavior, and population abundance. Native species
              richness tends to decline in urban areas; however, changes in
              abundance appear to be species specific. These shifts in ecology
              suggest that urbanization could affect both adaptive and
              non-adaptive evolution of herbivorous arthropods and their host
              plants in urban environments. However, plant-herbivore
              interactions may be dramatically altered if either arthropods or
              plants are unable to tolerate urban environments. Thus, while
              some species can physiologically acclimate or genetically adapt
              to the abiotic urban environment, many species are expected to
              decline in abundance. We conclude with suggestions for future
              research to advance our understanding of how urbanization alters
              the ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions.",
